# ClassRosterSystem
C++ project for WGU - Creating a simple class roster system based from a starting input string that seperates students into three different catergories. Software Student, Security Student, and Network Student.
Students are able to be deleted, and edited, and information about an individual student, a student group or the whole roster can be displayed on the console.
