# ClassRosterSystem
C++ project for WGU Scripting and Programming Applications - Creating a simple class roster system based from a starting
input string that separates students into three different categories. Software Student, Security Student, and Network 
Student.
Students are able to be deleted, and edited, and information about an individual student, a student group or the whole 
roster can be displayed on the console.

This was the first project I've ever done with C++ I enjoyed it a lot, it helped me really understand how to utilize 
resources, the studying I did on how to handle garbage collection was extremely eye opening, as I'm used to languages like
Java and Ruby where that is done automatically.

## Screenshot
Attached below is a screenshot of the output of the program. If you have any questions please let me know, I'd love to hear
from you!
